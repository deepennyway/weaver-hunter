title: Surviving Death
parent: main
order: 9
---

When a character drops to 0 health, they die. But death is not the end. A deadly poison renders you unable to move, or you fall over the side of the ship, or you get swallowed by a god.

Death means your character is separated from the group. They're on their own, lost in the world. If the group works hard enough, they may eventually find your lost character.

> For the moment this is just advice, there are no dice or card mechanics for how to handle these pieces, just suggestions for how to handle the situation if a character dies. The assumption is that you will want to bring your character back, so that's what we're addressing here, but if you'd rather just let them go and say good-bye, you can have a funeral instead of a search.

For the rest of the group, the game's story continues without your lost friend. Maybe you spend time looking for them, or maybe you try to move on with your lives and forget about them.

## Survival
While you're dead, you're on your own. Use your skills to survive, and try to send a message to your friends to let them know you're alive.

> Maybe card prompts tell you what kinds of challenges you face in death?

> Something in here about how surviving death changes you, leaves you stronger than you were before because you had to push yourself harder? More health maybe?

## The Signal
Eventually, you find a way to get a message to your friends: You're alive, you're somewhere they can find you, they just have to come and get you.

*Probably* there's some series of puzzles, skill checks, or even a violent encounter that the group has to complete before they can get you back. It's very important that nobody die during this rescue mission, or you'll end up in a cycle of rescue forever. That might be fun the first time, but if it keeps happening, maybe it's time to try something different.

> This is the first time I'm thinking of it, but probably need to scaffold some rules for the GM about "here's how you build a dungeon ahead of time, and here's how you build one on the fly."
