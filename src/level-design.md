So you're the GM and you like making maps and planning ahead, and you want to build a nice little dungeon for the players to wander around in before they get to the thing they're looking for. Maybe that thing is a tool they need in order to fight their chosen enemy, or maybe it's the enemy itself. Maybe the dungeon is metaphorical, like a series of social tests they need to pass before the Demon Court will grant them an audience where they can bargain for the poison they need to kill the Crystal Demon.

## Step 1: Map it out
If it's a physical dungeon, draw a map. Put markers on the map for points of interest, skill checks you know you'll want to ask for, obstacles the players will have to overcome, as well as any puzzles that you want to block their way.

If it's a metaphorical dungeon, you can map that out too, but it might look more like a flowchart or diagram. Basically you want to have an idea of what's likely to happen and when, so that when you're playing you can refer to your map to give you a guide for pacing.

Your map could even just be a list of skill checks and puzzles. It's up to you.

## Step 2: Set expectations
If there's a place where you want a skill check to happen, write down some basic details about the circumstances and some ideas for why you want that skill check to come up.

If there's a puzzle, figure out what sort of puzzle it is, and set its target number.

## Step 3: Run it
Once you're ready, just go ahead and run it. Be prepared for the map to become useless if the players do something you didn't expect, or to ask the players for help in sticking to the diagram so you don't get lost.
