## Traits
> What's the mythic term for **something that makes this person larger than life**? This is that. I'm going to build out the rest of the rules around the needs of these heroic traits.

Everyone gets one of these to start. If you want more, you have to make a deal with a god or something.

- **Strong**
    - *Powerful*
    - *Tough*
- **Quick**
    - *Flexible*
    - *Reflexes*
- **Arcane**
- **Empathic**

### Arcane
You are tapped into the network of global consciousnesses that form the world's memory.
- When you weave, you roll twice and choose which roll to keep.
- When you weave, you see what the effects would be after you roll but before the weaving manifests, and you can choose to cancel the entire weaving.

### Empathic
You have a deep emotional attunement to those around you, whether they share your social context or not.
- You can bond with spells.

Note that being tuned to the emotional life of an entity does not necessarily mean that someone will act with care for that entity's well-being. Plenty of empathic individuals nevertheless abuse their spells to suit their own ends.

### Strong
You are strong.
- You can carry one additional piece of equipment.
- Most characters can carry only two. This means you can carry three.
- A piece of equipment is something you can hold in your hands, wear on your body, or stow away somewhere on your person for easy access.

### Quick
You are quick.
- You can move to fight a foe that is far away as if they were nearby.
- You can fight a foe that is nearby as if they were next to you.
- Most characters can only move next to a foe that is nearby.

### Flexible
You can shift stances as easily as breathing.
- You can change between "Fight" and "Shoot" even when it's not your turn.

### Reflexes
You act faster than you think.
- When a foe fights you and misses, you automatically succeed on your check to fight back.

### Powerful
Your blows can topple mountains.
- When you hit with your "fight" ability, the potency of your hit is increased.

### Tough
You can withstand the worst punishment imaginable.
- You negate the first hit you take during every fight. If you have armor, you instead negate the first two hits.



## Concepts
These are the concepts established by the above traits.

### Distance
How far someone is from you tells you whether and how you can engage with them during a fight.
- **Next to Me:** You can fight them without moving. You cannot shoot them.
- **Nearby:** You can fight them, but you must move first. You can shoot them.
- **Far Away:** You can shoot them, but you cannot fight them. You can move to be nearby, but you risk being hit if they are prepared to use their "shoot" ability.

If a foe is too far to reach with the "shoot" ability, they're not in the scene.

### Fight Check
During a fight, you can "fight" any target that is next to you.
- Make a "fight" check
- If your check succeeds, you hit your target
- If your check fails and your target is prepared to fight, they may immediately fight back.

**Fight Back:** When a foe fails a fight check against you, if you are prepared to fight, you can immediately make a fight check against that same foe. If you fail this check, the foe does not get to fight back.

## Equipment
Equipment is used to augment your abilities or to grant you additional abilities.

### Sword
A sword is a piece of equipment that augments your "fight" ability.
- When your fight check fails, the likelihood of you being hit by your target is reduced.
- When your fight check succeeds, the potency of your hit is increased.

### Bow
A bow is a piece of equipment that grants you a new ability, "shoot", which you can use in place of "fight".
- Shoot works exactly like Fight, except that it can be used from a distance of Nearby or Far Away without having to move.
- You can only be prepared to Fight or Shoot at any given time; switching costs nothing but can only be done once on your turn.

### Armor
Armor is a piece of equipment that augments your passive "defend" ability.
- When you are hit for the first time during a fight, you lose no health from that hit.

### Potion
A potion is a piece of equipment that grants you a new ability, **Elixir**, which you can use once per fight.

> #### Elixir
> Drinking your potion gives you an additional point of health and augments your "fight" ability as if you were using a sword. If you fail a fight check, you become **unpredictable** until the end of the fight.
>
> **Unpredictable:** While in this state, any time you use your "fight" ability, make an additional check after your initial fight check. If the second check is higher, your hit is redirected to someone other than your target—someone on your side of the fight. Your hit deals no damage, but your new target loses their next turn as they fend off your attacks.

## Mnemons
A mnemon (rhymes with "demon") is a living memory that inhabits the world and has developed consciousness. Mnemons are memories given form that are otherwise ephemeral or temporary, but that usually want to bond with weavers who are attuned to their needs. Mnemons gain strength and vitality from this bond, assuming the weaver takes good care of them. A mnemon without a weaver can sometimes survive on their own, but will most often fade away naturally as the world shifts around them. There is nothing inherently bad or frightening about this fading; it's as natural as dying. Of course, some mnemons might not *want* to die, but that is a separate consideration.

They are separate consciousnesses from the world's memory but function in a similar way, with manifestations that to the untrained eye might appear indistinguishable from patterns of weaving.

Anyone can weave. Not everyone can bond with a mnemon.

> **Etymology:** Archaic form *mnæmon*, which modern usage has shifted to "mnemon". Phonetic similarities to "demon" suggest that demon is also a divergent pronunciation of mnæmon, and in some places the words "mnemon" and "demon" are used interchangeably. The world is philosophically described as "mnemonic" as a commentary on the ubiquity of mnemons throughout existence, both current and historical.

Mnemons are described in greater detail in the Mnemons chapter.

## Weaving
Weaving means tapping into the network of global consciousnesses that form the world's memory. It's a dangerous thing to do because some memories are dangerous.

Note that weaving is not the same as bonding with a mnemon. The memory you tap into is fleeting and a part of the world's memory; it never belongs to you, it has no opinions about you or your current situation. You can no more bond with a weaving than you could bond with your friend's memory of the sandwich they ate yesterday, nor could you control what that sandwich would do if you somehow pulled it out of your friend's stomach and waved it around in the air.

Most weavings follow a straight-forward pattern:
- Choose a weaving pattern.
- Roll a die.
- Carry out the result.

You can weave during a fight, but fights are already dangerous; why would you then also tap into the volatile energies of the world's uninhibited memories? Sounds like a bad time.
