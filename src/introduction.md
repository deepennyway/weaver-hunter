> For a thousand years they held reign over the world, sitting atop a mountain of wealth and constructing all sorts of terrible inventions. The dragons are gone now, but dangerous reminders of their rule remain out there in the Grey, in the ruined places, in the shadows and the deep caves left by those for whom Enough was never sufficient.

*{{ site.title }}* is a multiplayer dice-and-card game about dealing with the after-effects of the dragons' empire. it is designed to be compatible with characters made for *Mnemonic* or *Buried Echoes*, and focuses specifically on the violent encounters between the players' characters, called hunters, and the monsters left behind by the Imperial Dragons.

> You don't *have* to spend most, much, or any time pursuing the enemies described in the Bestiary. You can focus on smaller scenes or sprawling dungeons using the rules for skill checks and puzzles, you can spend your time bonding with spells and wandering the world in pursuit of objectives that are less violent.

> I'm going to do my best to scaffold the pieces that aren't violent so that you can do that more easily, but you should know that the primary purpose of this game text is to help you construct confrontations with violent, dangerous foes. Anything else is secondary to that goal.

The game's rules assume that you have someone serving as a facilitator for the experience, referred to interchangeably as the GM (Game Master) or Facilitator. I prefer Facilitator for this role personally, but sometimes GM is fewer letters to type and that's all that matters in the moment.

## Required Materials
In order to play *{{ site.title }}*, you must have:
- Some six-sided dice with numbers on them from 1 to 6
- A standard four-suit poker deck, Jokers included
- Some way to keep track of health and locked suits

I recommend having paper and pencils to write things down, but for the basic rules you can get by with coins or tokens instead.

## The State of It
> This isn't finished, there's pieces missing that I need to figure out and write down, so it might not be fully playable yet. But I'm hoping that the text here gives you a sense of how it will play, and *hopefully* you'll have a sense of whether or not it's the right vibe for what you're looking for in a game.

## The Grey Hunters
Out there in the Grey, where the Imperial Dragons did their worst violence to the world's memories, all manner of awful things wander about. Some of them are benign, echoes of people or places that were lost. Others are dangerous monsters, distorted manifestations of events that happened long ago that the world is unable to forget.

For those who wear the mask of the hunter or the weaver, the Grey is...it's not our home. Our homes are in the villages and towns and cities and solitary homesteads where our pillows and our nice blankets await us at the end of our journey. Our homes are the friends and families watching for signs of our return.

The Grey is not our home. But it is the place where we do our work, seeking the monsters left behind by the fallen empire. When we find them, we destroy them if we can, or seal them away where they can cause no more harm.

When you find echoes that need laying to rest, if you need help moving on from the pain of your past, call a weaver. They're very good at what they do; some hunters are also weavers.

But when a monster appears from out of the grey, you call a hunter.
