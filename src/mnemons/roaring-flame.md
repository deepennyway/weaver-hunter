title: The Raging Inferno
---

Each fire is different. Some are content to crackle and dance on the wick of a candle, or quietly consume logs in a campfire. Even a forest fire, carefully tended, knows its intention and its purpose and goes about its business for as long as it needs to.

But every fire has memories, painful ones, of the cost of their warmth, of the things they consume. And when a fire burns too hot, consumes too much, it becomes fuel for its own anger and rage.

Few weavers prepare this spell on purpose. It is volatile, and angry, and dangerous. For most weavers who carry this spell, it is prepared upon them by circumstances, misfortune, or villainous intent.

## Preparation
When a fire burns out of control, it may seek out a nearby weaver to carry it. The bond might form out of desperation as the flames try to contain their own power within a vessel, or it might emerge from the fire's unquenchable thirst.

For the weaver, preparing this spell might feel like a cool breeze, a welcome reprieve from the heat. That heat usually comes from standing inside the flames. A burning building, or a sacrificial pyre, or on the receiving end of another weaver's torment.

When the raging inferno enters the weaver, it leaves the blaze behind. When a house that was consumed with flames suddenly sputters out, it might be because the flames have found a weaver to call home.

## Understanding the Flames
The inferno needs to feed, constantly. To keep yourself from burning up, you'll need plenty of water to cool yourself, and enough food to keep both you and the inferno satisfied.

If you can survive the presence of the inferno long enough, you might be able to communicate with it and find out what it needs in order to resolve its anger. But if the flames do not want to be quelled, they may decide to leave you in pursuit of another host.

While the inferno rides within you, its presence is palpable and obvious: your eyes glow like burning embers, your hair seems to shimmer and ripple like waves of heat, and your touch may even be painful to those who are sensitive to heat.

## Abilities & Traits

## Termination
In addition to the terms established when you formed the bond, the Raging Inferno will terminate the bond early if any of the following occurs:

If the bond is terminated early for any reason, the Raging Inferno burns you in its departure, taking away one point of health as if you had been hit with fire.
