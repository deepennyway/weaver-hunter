title: The Flickering Flame
---

Not every fire is the same, but in the place where this spell was developed, the flames are ready and eager to accompany any patient weaver on their journey, to keep them warm and protect them from harm.

- suit: diamonds 2
- skill: fire weaving +3

## Preparation
Preparing this spell involves spending time (usually about an hour) in communion with a crackling flame, such as a campfire or hearth. When you feel yourself falling away, when your eyes grow tired, the flames will flicker and dance and, if you trust each other, join their life with yours.

So to prepare this spell, you’ll need whatever you need to build a fire. Wood, tinder, something to light it. Many weavers find that the careful process of building a fire helps guide their mind to the place of soft-focus that allows the bond to form, but most of the time the flames don’t care much about your specific methods.

## Understanding the Flames
The flames don’t need much to survive, but they do need fuel; don’t prepare this spell if you don’t have plenty of food to eat, because while the flames are inside you you will always be hungry.

Drinking water won’t put the flames out (contrary to conventional wisdom), but the flames don’t particularly like water and will do their best to stop you thinking about how long it’s been since you had something to drink.

To the people who know you well, your skin might be warmer to the touch than usual, and your movements might appear slightly more erratic than your normal behavior, as a result of the flames flickering throughout your body.

## Passive Manifestations
While the flames travel with you, your skills are augmented in the following ways:
- Your Fire Weaving skill, if you have any at all, is 1 higher than normal.
- Your Swimming skill, if you have any, is halved.
- Your Moth-Friend skill, if you have any, is doubled.

## Casting the Spell
To cast the spell, use its suit and skill as if they were your own. You can cast the spell even if your Diamonds skill is locked; the spell’s suit is separate from your own.

You may cast the spell as often as you like until it leaves you, or until you release it (see below).

The flames do not like to be abused, and they would rather not fight other people’s battles. If you ever use the spell to damage the Health of an enemy, the spell will leave you at the end of that encounter.

## Releasing the Spell
You don’t have to cast the spell in order to remove it from yourself; you can release it at any time, into any open flame where there is enough fuel to sustain the fire as it leaves you.

The flames might have opinions about where they’d like to be released, which might even be part of the act of preparation.

## After Effects
If you release the flames with care, there are no after-effects once the spell is gone.

If you use the flames to damage an enemy’s Health, when the spell leaves you it also locks your Fire Weaving skill.
