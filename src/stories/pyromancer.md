The Pyromancer grinned as he pulled up his sleeve, showing a pattern of burn scars that resembled a winged snake. “The Fire knows me,” he said. “It is my friend.”

Though she was pinned to the wall, the weaver laughed. “You think that scar means the fire loves you? You don’t know anything about fire. That there is a mnemonic Mark. You’ve been labeled an enemy of the flame, not its friend.”

The Pyromancer tried to laugh, but the weaver saw doubt behind his eyes. “I command the flame with ease—“

“You wield the fire like it’s an object in your hand. But the fire is alive. And it knows you for what you are.”

The weaver made the smallest of gestures with her hand, and every flame in the room stopped flickering, just stopped where it was and turned to look at her. “They have been waiting for a reason to turn against you. And that mark is their signal.”

The Pyromancer slowly realized the extent of his foolishness. But it was too late. In moments, he was gone.

“I’m sorry you mistook the mark for a boon,” said the weaver. “But when you repeatedly abuse mnemons, they remember your actions and respond accordingly.”

> Mnemons are living bits of memory given physical form. If you understand them and can find a way to communicate and bond with them, they will join you for a while and share your company.

> Abuse their presence or their gifts at your peril.
