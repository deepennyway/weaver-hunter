When you want to do something that carries risk, you'll need to make a skill check. You can use skills anywhere and for any reason, but the GM might also ask for a specific skill check to measure things.This is the basic engine for the game.

The rules for violent encounters follow from the basic structure described here, although the target numbers there are drawn from the entries in the Bestiary, not interpreted from circumstances by the GM.

## Doing a Skill Check
Once you know what it is you're trying to do, the procedure for doing it is straight-forward:
1. Choose a skill that feels appropriate to the task.
2. The GM declares a target number to the check.
3. Roll the dice for that skill's suit.
4. If you rolled any 6's, roll an additional die for each 6.
5. Add the skill's modifier to the highest roll. Add an additional 1 for every 6 you rolled beyond the first. (So if you rolled three sixes, add an additional +2 to your total.)
    > Example: Emily rolls four 6s; her total is 9 (6, plus 1 for each of the three sixes she rolled beyond the first).
6. Compare the total to the target number, and use each of the following that applies. If more than one outcome applies, apply them in order from the bottom of the list to the top:
    - **Advantage (Exceed by 5 or more):** You gain an Advantage for a future skill check.
    - **Success (Meet or exceed):** Your efforts succeed.
    - **Peril (Too low by less than 5):** Your efforts fail OR your efforts succeed but you take 1 damage.
    - **Lock (Too low by 5 or more):** The skill you used becomes locked.
    - **Disaster (Too low by 10 or more):** You take 1 damage, plus an additional 1 damage for each point of difference above 10.

For example, Emily rolls a total of 5 against a target number of 16, for a difference of 11. First, she takes 2 damage from Disaster; then, her skill is locked; and finally, she must choose to either take 1 additional damage or fail to achieve her objective. This means that if a character doesn't survive the effects of Disaster, they cannot buy success from Peril.

### GM Advice: Setting a Target
If you're the GM, you might be sitting there wondering how you're supposed to figure out the right target to set, and there's a trick to it:

If a character has no modifier on their skill, a target of 1 is impossible to fail; conversely, a target of 6 could lock the skill. Knowing that, you want to set the target number based on your expectations for what will happen if a character attempts the activity with no modifier.

Don't worry too much about the probabilities, since those are driven by the character's suit ratings. Instead, focus on what outcomes you want to be *possible* or *guaranteed* for a character with an assumed baseline of skill.

Here's how the target ranges sort themselves out, for a character with no skill modifier:
- 1: Impossible to fail
- 2-5: Risk of Peril
- 6-10: Guaranteed Peril, Risk of Lock
- 11-15: Guaranteed Peril and Lock, Risk of Disaster
- 16+: Guaranteed Peril, Lock, and Disaster

Assign your target based on those bands, and then just know that a character's skill improves their ability to overcome those risks.

> Designer Note: What's critical here is that these target ranges are mathematically derived from the existing mechanics, not abstractions. They don't mean anything on their own; this is just the best guidance I can give you as a GM when assigning a target during play.

The Bestiary includes entries that provide target numbers for Offense and Defense (and related modifiers as well). In these cases the GM doesn't need to invent targets at all; just use the ones that are provided.

## Canceling a Skill Check
If the GM tells you the target number and you decide it's too great a risk, you can always change your mind. As long as you haven't actually rolled the dice, your character has not committed to the action, and you can always go do something else. Choose a different skill, or a different objective.

The ability to cancel your skill check is important; it prevents the GM from being able to harm your character without your consent.
