Sometimes your objective is to answer a very specific question, or fix a very specific problem. In these cases, there's no room for error; you have to get it *exactly right* or the whole thing won't work. The light won't turn on, or the door won't open, or the ceiling will cave in, or the guardian of the secret door won't let you pass.

I'm going to call these situations, collectively, *puzzles*. The GM sets a target number; your job is to use a pool of modifiers drawn from one of your skills

## Solving the Puzzle
Once the puzzle has been identified, solving it follows this process:

1. The GM declares a target number.
    > hmmm, is this step necessary or could we just set it universally
2. Draw a card to form a base.
3. Choose a skill.
4. Roll your dice and form a pool of modifiers.
5. Use your pool as positive or negative modifiers to the base, trying to reach a total that exactly matches the target number.
6. Assess the outcome:
    - Perfect Match: You complete the puzzle.
    - Too Low: Look for something to help you, then try again from step 2.
    - Too High: The puzzle is broken; find another path.

### Working Together
Multiple characters can work together to solve the same puzzle! Probably they should, even!

After step 2, once the target number has been revealed, anyone can volunteer to help out with the skill check. Everyone rolls their skills separately, and puts all of their modifiers into the same pool.

So if Emily and Rachel work together, their modifier pool might look like this:
- 2, 6, 1 (from Emily)
- 3 (from Rachel)

Having more modifiers to use makes it more likely that the group, collectively, will be able to solve the puzzle.

### GM Advice: Setting the Target Number
I would say follow the same advice here you use for any other skill check, except that the driving force here is this: A character with a rating of 1 and no modifier will have a single modifier somewhere between 1 and 6, and although you don't want that character to *always* be able to succeed, you should know that the highest card (apart from Aces and Jokers) they can draw as a base has a value of 10, and the lowest has a value of 2. So I would set the target number somewhere between 2 and 16.

Unlike skill checks, higher numbers don't necessarily mean more difficult puzzles. In fact, given the number of face cards in the deck, a player is much more likely to draw a 10 (16 cards) than a 2 (4 cards).

A character with no modifier and a rating of 1 who draws a 10 has a 1-in-6 chance of hitting any target number between 11 and 16.

Unless the puzzle *expects* multiple people working together in order to solve it, I would set the target with the assumption that a single player will work on their own. Your players will likely want to work together, but I recommend letting them use that collaboration as a guard against probability.

## The Brain Dump
Sometimes your objective is to answer a very specific question, or fix a very specific problem. In these cases, there's no room for error; you have to get it *exactly right* or the whole thing won't work. The light won't turn on, or the door won't open, or the ceiling will cave in, or the guardian of the secret door won't let you pass.

I'm going to call these situations, collectively, *puzzles*. The GM will set a target number; your job is to use your skills and dice to roll exactly that number.

Seems impossible, right? You get one roll and that's it? Well, no. You don't just get one roll. Here's how it works.

Let's say the target number is 15, to open a locked door. Emily knows here that failing to hit that number will set off an alarm, or activate a trap, or do something that she doesn't want to happen.

So first things first: she chooses a skill she thinks will be appropriate to the task, and how she plans to approach it. (As a point of order, the GM should never set up a puzzle that requires a specific skill that is not in the player's existing arsenal, unless the player is about to be presented with ways to acquire that skill or work around it.)

Emily has Fire Weaving. It's a good skill to use: it's in her strong suit, and that suit has a rating of 2, and it also has a modifier of +1. "I'm going to try and very carefully melt the lock."

The GM nods to this. "Okay, the challenge here is to avoid melting the lock in a way that fuses the door shut. Go ahead."

Once you have a skill chosen, draw a card from the deck to serve as your base. Jacks, Queens, and Kings count as 10s; Aces count as either 1s or 11s (your choice). Jokers count as 15s. Here, Emily draws a Jack of Spades, giving her a base value of 10.

Roll your skill's dice to form a pool of modifiers. Here, Emily rolls a 2 and a 6, and her total modifier for Fire Weaving is 3. So her pool of modifiers is 2, 3, and 6.

Add or subtract your modifiers one at a time from the base value. You don't have to use all of your modifiers for this.

Here, Emily adds both her 2 and her 3 to the 10 for a total of 15, which matches the target number, signifying that the puzzle has been completed successfully! The lock melts away, and she proceeds into the vault. (as an added narrative bonus, the GM might say that now that Emily has done it once, she can bypass all future locks within this same area, saving time both within the story and at the table.)

That's what success looks like. If Emily's total was too low, that might mean that she discovers this approach won't work for that puzzle, or that she's missing something to help. She can try again after examining the lock or looking for some additional leverage.

If the total was too *high*, that means that the puzzle is busted completely, and Emily will have to find another way past the door.
