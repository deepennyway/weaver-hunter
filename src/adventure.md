If the violent encounter with an enemy from the Bestiary is the set-piece for {{ site.title }}, then the Adventure is everything leading up to that confrontation. If there's a formulaic pattern of events to each adventure, it might look something like:
1. Find out about the existence of the enemy
2. Go to the place where the enemy is doing harm
3. Learn what you can about the enemy
4. Prepare to confront the enemy
5. Confront the enemy

Seems simple enough. And I think I want to frame the adventure as a process of discovery. The farther you get through the process, the more you know about the enemy, until finally it's there in front of you and you have to deal with it.

## The Enemy
Maybe it's a letter from a friend asking you for help. You go to their house and they tell you what the enemy is and what it's doing. They ask you to destroy it, and you agree - or you don't agree, in which case we go do something else that day.

Maybe it's not a letter from someone else. Maybe you see the enemy's harm firsthand, and you realize that nobody else is going to do anything about it, so you make the decision to do it yourself.

This step is about making the decision, somehow, to pursue this enemy as a target. You don't know anything about the enemy's stats or how to kill it yet; all you know is its very basic information: what's it look like, why does it need killing.

## The Community
The enemy needs killing because it's doing something bad to the community. Maybe it's small things but if you're going to kill it, probably it's doing really bad things. Eating people, burning down forests, etc.
