> Some kind of scaffolding about who the characters are, what sort of people we expect them to be, a preamble to "so you want to make one of these, cool, here's how you do it"

## Starting Out
To begin with, everyone has four suits, which serve as the broad categories for their skills. The suits are:
- Hearts: Your body
- Diamonds: Your mind (and also magic)
- Spades: Your tools
- Clubs: Your environment and allies

Each suit begins with a rating of 1.

Choose one suit to be your character's Strong Suit. When you use a skill from your strong suit, you add the suit's rating as an extra bonus on top of the skill's modifier.

## Choosing Skills
You begin with one skill under each suit. This skill is a good starting point for thinking about who your character is and how they engage with the world. Write down the names of your starting skills now. (There's a list of sample skills for each suit in the Suits chapter.)

Skills begin with no modifier, and that's okay.

Finally, write down two additional skills, under any suit(s) you like. Having multiple skills in a suit is useful because it means that if one of them becomes locked, you can still do things with that suit (which is useful in situations where you need to use a specific suit to do something).

## Starting Health
You begin with 4 health.

## Experience Points
I'm going to assume your character is some kind of veteran to whatever trades they've taken up, and that experience makes you more resilient, or more skilled, or deepens your talents.

To represent that, you start with 6 Experience Points. Spend them as you like on the following things. Unless otherwise noted, each improvement costs 1 point. You can choose items more than once.
- (2 points) Increase one suit's rating by 1
- Increase one skill's modifier by 1
- Learn one new skill
- Increase your health by 1

You'll get more Experience Points (EP) during play that you can spend on the above items, and certain events will also grant you specific improvements, so don't worry too much if your stats don't feel quite up to snuff.

You can save any unspent EP for later, but you should know that you won't be able to spend them until your group rests.

## Finishing Touches
Give your character a name. Figure out what they look like, write down any defining pieces of equipment you want them to have, and start thinking about who they are and why they're doing what they do. How did they end up here, with this group, doing this job.

You're ready to play.
