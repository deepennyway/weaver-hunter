Weaving is an arrogant misnomer, but it's what everyone calls it. Weaving means looking for patterns in the world's memory, and tapping into one of those patterns in order to manifest a desired outcome.

The results are usually unpredictable in terms of potency, but if you tug on a strand of Rain, you can be sure that the result will have at least *something* to do with rain. It might be too little rain to do what you want, or it might be entirely too much rain, but rain will come.

Some things you should know about weaving before you do it:

First, anyone can weave. Everyone in the world has at least some awareness of the global network of consciousness that forms the world's memory, and can tug on those threads when they want to. It takes practice to identify specific patterns, and some people are more attuned to the tapestry than others, but once you know the threads are there, you can use them. So you don't have to do anything special in order to weave.

Second, weaving is dangerous. You are manipulating threads of living reality, the mind that powers the world and remembers the things that have happened in it. Pull too hard on a Fire strand, and you might get an inferno instead of a camp fire. Don't pull hard enough, and you won't get more than a spark.

The tapestry of memories is also delicate, if not fragile. If you pull too often on the same thread, you risk fraying its edges, or tearing it out of existence altogether. Damage to the world's tapestry of memory can cause all kinds of disastrous consequences, from altered geography to forgotten people, to changes to your own physical form or the events of your life. Yes, weaver: *you are also part of the world's collective memory*, and you yourself can be caught up in its tangled, snarled web.

For this reason, most people don't weave recklessly. And those that do are usually avoided, if not pursued and punished.

Some people learn to be more careful with their weaving, to sense which threads are growing close to tearing. But every pluck of a string damages it; do so with care and respect for the weavers who will come after you.

## When can I weave?
You can weave whenever you want. It doesn't require you to be doing something else; it doesn't modify anything you're already doing. When you decide to weave, just tell the group that's what you're doing.

**Wait, so can I weave during a fight?** Yes, you can. Weaving during a fight usually interrupts the fight, though. Everything about weaving requires interpretation, which means that you will likely need to adjust the circumstances of the fight based on what happens. If you set a foe on fire with your weaving, for example, you might represent that as them having less health, or even being taken out of the fight entirely.

## Mechanics of Weaving
So you read all of that and you still want to weave. Okay. The process is simple:

1. Decide on a desired general outcome.
2. Roll a die.
3. Interpret the results of your weaving.
4. Determine how your weaving has changed you, or changed the world in which you live.

The Weaver's Almanac contains many weavings that you can use to interpret your outcomes, but all of them are abstractions of the same template:

- **1:** This is a **Bend** effect. The weaving manifests in small, barely perceptible ways. You might not even notice them.
- **2-3:** This is a **Weave** effect. The weaving manifests in moderate, controlled ways, and does more or less what you would expect based on your knowledge of the thing you're weaving. Rain manifests rain, and all that.
- **4-5:** This is a **Fray** effect. The weaving manifests in powerful ways that are barely contained. People you know might be put in danger, although the effects are usually just shy of catastrophe.
- **6:** This is a **Tear** effect, as this thread of the tapestry breaks free and releases a torrent of mnemonic energy into the world. The effects manifest in wild and uncontrolled ways. The world notices catastrophes like this. You will need to spend time repairing the damage, or as much of it as you can with what's left.

## Heavier Mechanics
Those are the basics. Here are some additional features, but if you're already feeling overwhelmed you can stop here.

Here it is:

- On a result of **Fray**, some aspect of your physical form is altered in small, barely noticeable ways. Your hair might change color slightly, or you might be wearing a different shirt than the one you remember putting on this morning. The change is isolated to your immediate physical reality, but events and history remain unaltered.
- On a result of **Tear**, some part of your life becomes remarkably different. A life-altering accident from your youth suddenly never happened at all, for instance, and the physical scars on your body disappear. You might remember the accident still, but no one else does.

As a player, the changes to your character are up to you. If the changes also influence other players' characters' lives, consult them before committing to the changes. For instance, if your fellow player's character is your character's sister, you cannot turn them into your brother without checking in with that player first.

I'll let you decide within your group whether the people of the world remember the change. You might decide that it warps reality too much to have no one remember that weaver's accident, for instance, so you might instead have people remember that *something* happened, but that they can't reconcile their memory with the physical reality where there is no evidence of that accident occurring.

On the other hand, you might want to lean into the pain of living in a world you no longer recognize, where you remember something that everyone else insists never happened.

Either way, *be careful with yourself* if you use these mechanics. The story can get *real* heavy *real* fast depending on what things change. If you're looking to continue the game for a long time, you might want to limit the changes to things that don't result in psychological trauma for your characterâ€”or for you.
