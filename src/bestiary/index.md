Not everything has need of a full statistical break-down of its violent maneuvers, defenses, and health limits. Not everything needs it because we are assuming that when you go out to bring violence to your enemy, you're going out there *only* to fight your enemy, and not bring your weapons to the local flora and fauna. The people living in the town where your enemy has taken up residence are not, we expect, the targets of your violent intentions.

If you need to pick fights while in town, use the basic skill systems you're already familiar with, and treat those encounters like ordinary conflict resolutions.

What you're about to read represents violence with purpose. It requires planning, and conviction. Know why you're taking on these creatures. Know that although they were created by the Imperial Dragons, they are still very much alive; cruelty is not a part of your mission here. Mercy is a quick kill, *not* leaving the monster to lick its wounds and then return to the town to wreak further havoc.
