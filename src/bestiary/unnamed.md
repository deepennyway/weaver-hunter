The Unnamed has a snake tail and poisonous spines on its neck. It also has an six-spiked stinger on its tail. It also has dragon wings and can fly as fast as a peregrine falcon.

> Did you know that the peregrine falcon is the fastest animal on Earth? It can go more than 20 hundred miles per hour, and that's like *Ka-POW!*

It eats bats, birds, or anything else in its sightâ€”including humans. That's where we get into trouble. Because you see an unnamed beast flying around in the air off in the distance and you might think "Gosh what a majestic creature that is, flying around over there" but then it picks up one of your friends and carries them off to its volcano and you realize *No wait this thing is pretty dangerous actually and it's living way too close to my house.* So you call in a group of hunters to deal with the problem.

We'd much rather leave it be. But it won't leave us be. So we need your help.

You'll usually find the Unnamed hanging from a stalactite in its volcanic cave, if it isn't out hunting.

## Stats
- Offense: 7
- Defense: 8
- Health: 20

## Combat

### Nocturnal Invisibility
At night, if the Unnamed is out hunting, it will turn itself invisible to avoid being seen. While invisible, the Unnamed's Offense score and Defense scores are doubled.

The Unnamed becomes visible immediately after its first attack.

### Venomous Tail
On its turn, the Unnamed will use its tail spikes to attempt to stun the nearest target. If it hits, in addition to dealing damage, the Unnamed also locks whatever suit the target uses to defend itself.

### Bite
On its turn, the Unnamed will use its bite to deal 1 damage to the nearest incapacitated target. If there are no incapacitated targets, the Unnamed will not use this attack.

### Flight
On its turn, if the Unnamed took more than 2 damage since its last turn, it will use its wings to fly into the air.

While flying, the Unnamed's Defense score receives a +3 modifier, or a x2 modifier against any attack that requires close range (such as a sword). The Unnamed cannot use its Bite or Venomous Tail while flying.

The Unnamed will land if it took no damage since its last turn, or if it has less than 10 health remaining. On the turn when it lands, the Unnamed will attack with its Venomous Tail with a +2 modifier to its Offense score.

## Variation: Ground Unnamed
There is another creature, very similar to the Unnamed, but without the wings and with some other distinguishing features, like its snake-like tongue that possesses a mouth of its own. We call it the Ground Unnamed.

Despite their similarities, they are actually entirely different creatures. The Ground Unnamed has the same stats and abilities as the Unnamed, with the following exceptions:
- Health: 15
- Offense: 7
- Defense: 6
- No Flight
