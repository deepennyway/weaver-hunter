The Crystal Demon lives in a cave of horrible, distorted memories borne of the demon’s conquests in the Grey. It terrorizes people, leading them to ruin, and then harvests the resulting chaos as food for itself and its young.

Most of the time we try to leave the Crystal Demon alone; we haven’t found a reliable way of killing it permanently, and every time we’ve tried it just became angry and turned its ire against our community. Ask the tailor at the edge of town why he never works with wool thread anymore, if you really need to know why we don’t try to kill this monster anymore.

If you really want to go after it, if there’s no other way to get what you’re looking for, here’s what you need to know.

## Stats
- **Health:** 45
- **Defense:** 13 (10 vs Diamonds)
- **Offense:** 15 (18 vs Diamonds)

## Health
> When targeting the demon's Health, its Defense is -5.

The Crystal Demon can’t be killed by removing all its health, but it can be subdued. If you reduce its health to zero, on its turn it will use retreat in lieu of any other actions. If it cannot retreat, it will stay in place and do nothing.

### Recovery
The Crystal Demon recovers all of its health whenever you stop to rest.

### The killing blow

In order to permanently kill the Crystal Demon, you must reduce its health to zero and also render it Vulnerable.

At that point, a single targeted strike with an enchanted weapon, or a dose of Demonsbane, will slay the animal.

### Demonsbane
Don’t have an enchanted weapon? You can instead make a deal with the Demon Court to have your weapons treated with Demonsbane, a powerful poison used to render demons vulnerable to mortal wounds.

Know that making deals with the Demon Court is not something anyone should do lightly or out of convenience; they always demand a heavy price, and they do not wait for payment.

The use of demonsbane is granted to you for use only on the Crystal Demon; its use against anything other than the Crystal Demon is likely to provoke the anger of the Demon Court. It is also likely to prove ineffective against anything other than the creature it was made to kill.

## Armor (x2 vs diamonds)
The Crystal Demon’s hide is covered in plates made of a material so hard our weapons cannot break it. Knowing what we do about its behavior and diet, we suspect the plates to be made of crystallized memory; if that is the case, then any enchanted weapon should be able to damage the crystal, if you hit it hard enough.

### Armor Track
- Undamaged
    - While the demon’s armor is undamaged, attacks against its health do a maximum of 1 damage.
    - On its turn, the demon will only ever use retaliation.
- Cracked
    - While the demon’s armor is cracked, attacks against its health deal half damage.
    - On its turn, the demon will use both claw attack and retaliation.
- Broken
    - While the demon’s armor is broken, attacks against its health deal normal damage.
    - On its turn, the demon will use both claw attack and venomous spit.
- Vulnerable
    - While the demon is vulnerable, attacks against its health deal double damage.
    - On its turn, the demon will use venomous spit and either rage or retreat.

### Breaking the Armor
To break the demon’s armor and move it down the Armor Track, make a targeted strike with an enchanted weapon OR with a weapon treated with demonsbane.

If your attack is successful, the Crystal Demon immediately uses retaliation.

### Recovery
The Crystal Demon’s armor repairs itself over time as the demon feeds, but the process takes many years. For the context in which you are likely to face it, the demon’s armor cannot recover on its own.

## Combat
The Crystal Demon behaves differently depending on the state of its armored plating, as shown in the Armor Track above.

### Claw Attack (/2 vs diamonds)
The Crystal Demon’s claws are deadly tools, but while its armor is undamaged it will not use them without cause.

If the demon’s armor is damaged in any way, it will begin its turn by making a claw attack at the nearest combatant.

### Retaliation (/2 vs diamonds)
If a combatant reduces the demon’s Health, the demon will, on its turn, attack that combatant.

If multiple combatants harm the demon in this way, the demon will target the combatant that did the most damage.

### Venomous Spit
The Crystal Demon has a sac of thick venom that it can spit to subdue its prey. In combat, the demon will only use this ability after its armor has been broken.

The demon’s retaliation attack is enhanced with venom: if the target is not immediately next to the demon, it will spit venom instead of using its claw attack.

If multiple combatants damage the demon’s health before its turn, the demon will spray venom in a wide arc around itself, targeting every combatant within spitting distance.

In addition to damaging the target’s health, this attack also locks the target’s hearts suit.

### Retreat
If the Crystal Demon is vulnerable, it will attempt to flee into its secret den. Once there, it will seal itself inside and remain inaccessible until its health is fully recovered.

### Rage
The Crystal Demon will try to retreat to its den if it is rendered vulnerable. If retreat is not an option, if there is no clear path to its den, it will instead lash out against everyone nearby.

At the start of its turn, the Crystal Demon makes a Claw Attack against every combatant within reach. If only one combatant is within reach, the demon instead makes four such attacks against that combatant. This replaces the demon’s claw attack.
