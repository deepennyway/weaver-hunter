title: Weaver//Hunter
---

In this game, you're either a weaver or a hunter, entering the Grey in order to do your work. I'm imagining this as a pair of games that coalesce together to make a third game when the weaver and hunter are working together.

I enjoy having a facilitator to focus these types of games, so it's not a solo game, but the vibe is "a solitary character on their own" rather than a group of characters all working together.

This means that if you have both a weaver and a hunter, the game supports three players.

## Getting Started
To begin, decide:

- Are you a weaver, or a hunter?

If you're a **weaver**, your task is to find an answer to some problem being faced by your community at home. A riverbed that has dried up, or a lack of rain for the crops, or a feud between dangerously powerful families.

If you're a **hunter**, your task is to find a remnant of the Old Empire that needs to be destroyed. A weapon, or a monstrosity, or an abused mnemon that can't find peace.

Both of these types of tasks require you to venture out into the thick fog that surrounds your community, referred to as the Grey. Whether you seek a solution or an enemy, you'll find it out there.

The Grey presents many challenges. Shifting landscapes, dangerous pits caused by unknown acts of violence, and hostile echoes will bring the untrained wanderer to an early end. Luckily, you are experienced. Most of these challenges you will easily overcome with the tools you brought with you, and the knowledge you've acquired after years in your profession.

## Expertise
Part of the game is establishing your expertise. *How* do you avoid or overcome these lesser dangers that have claimed so many lives before you? How did you know to be ready for them? Failure isn't the question here. Even if your character is someone who stumbles their way through life, they'll have a certain amount of uncanny luck that ensures their survival in these situations.

## Pushing the Limit
Eventually, you'll get to a part of the Grey that requires you to push yourself. You'll need something you didn't bring, or you'll face an enemy you've never seen before. Maybe you have encountered this type of challenge before but it always gives you a problem. You'll be hurt, or lose something you'll need later.

## Mortal Peril
Here is the question: Is this a story about you solving the problem, or is it about being interrupted by a much bigger problem?

Probably it's both. The problem you came here to solve turns out to be much bigger and more complicated than you thought. The riverbed dried up because a massive mnemonic turtle appeared and made its nest at the river's source. The weapon has been claimed by someone seeking to defend their home from a king's armies. The feud was instigated by a mnemon that feeds on memories of past grudges.

Whatever it is, it is beyond anything you've dealt with before. And of course it is, or else we wouldn't care about this story; you'd just kill the monster or move the turtle and go home. That might be fine for the start of an adventure, but not for where we are now.

So this is a period of peril. You might die. You might not. You will have to put yourself at risk in order to proceed.

That's the narrative context. But in the game layer, the new question is this:
- Do you want this character to survive?

If not, then this is a story of what you do before the Grey takes you, and what happens after. Maybe this is the prologue to a much longer story. Maybe you heroically sacrifice yourself in order to destroy the Old Empire weaponry, so that no one else will die from its use.

But if you want to survive, then just like Establishing Expertise, we have to answer the question of *how* you survive, and whether or not you solve the problem, and what happens when you return to town.

> To be decided before I take this idea any further: IS THIS A GAME THAT GENERATES A STORY OR IS IT A GAME THAT GENERATES THE SATISFACTION OF DEMONSTRATING SKILL OR IS IT A GAME THAT GENERATES EXCITEMENT FROM THE ANTICIPATION OF FINDING OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
