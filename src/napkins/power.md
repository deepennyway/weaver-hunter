title: Power is the Corruption

> *It's a day that ends in Y....*

Whenever someone with a big platform says something infuriating or ignorant, I try to remember a couple of things:

1. A lot of people say infuriating or ignorant things who don't have big platforms, and we don't necessarily run them out of town for it
2. It's not my job to tell people what they're allowed to think in their own heads
3. Platforms are not naturally occurring structures, and we shouldn't treat them as if they were
4. Ruining someone's day doesn't stop them doing harmful things, but it does make us feel good in the moment, which means it's a possible path to forming harmful habits in ourselves
5. The platform is the root of our problem with what this person did or said

I don't mean that Twitter is the single curse on our existence (although it is a curse, I think), I mean that no one should have so much power that they can have a stray thought in their head, say it out loud, and suddenly a hundred thousand people have heard and reacted to it.

I don't think the platform makes you a bad person. I think the platform itself is an aberration that toxifies everyone who interacts with it, whether they want to or not.

This is a helpful framing for me because when *someone with a big platform* says or does something terrible on Twitter, I can hold three simultaneous separate thoughts in parallel:

1. I would like to examine what they did or said so that I can learn from his mistakes without having to make them myself
2. If they didn't have so much influence, I wouldn't care
3. This person sucks because they actively construct their own platform on a daily basis, which is something that I think probably no one should do in the first place

There's the saying "Power corrupts" which we like to respond to by saying "lots of people with power aren't shitty people" but then we also like to say "stop putting people on pedestals."

Someday we'll realize that the pedestals themselves are the core problem, regardless of who's on them. And then we'll be able to refocus our attention in a way that allows us to respond to things in a reasonable way--whether it's something someone else did, or something we did ourselves.

> **TLDR:** We like to look at what the powerful people did that shows their ignorance or hypocrisy as if those were things that were inherently evil. But everyone says and does ignorant and hypocritical things; the difference is the power we wield while doing those things.
