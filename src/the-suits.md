Okay you've seen the suits named, but what do they actually mean, and what sorts of skills do they represent? This is that break-down. Some sample skills are provided for each suit, but you should know that anything you can think up is fair game here; the mechanics don't care about the narrative implications of what a skill is called.

## Hearts (The Body)
The Body refers to your ability to use your physical form as a tool. Jumping, climbing, punching and kicking, holding your breath, hidingâ€”these are all bodily skills.

Basically, the Body encompasses anything you do with your physical self.

**Sample Skills:**
- Swim
- Dash
- Jump
- Hide
- Push
- Fight
- Punch

## Diamonds (The Mind)
The Mind refers to things you do by thinking about them, usually by having thought about them ahead of time. So knowing math would be a good mental skill, as would logic or spatial relationships.

The Mind also refers to skills that require you to engage with the memories of the world, which encompasses many forms of magic. So Fire Weaving would be a good mental skill, even though it is engaging with a force outside of yourself.

**Sample Skills:**
- Fire Weaving (or any other Weaving)
- Logic
- Marine Biology
- Agricultural Botany
- Crossword Puzzles
- Communism

## Spades (The Tool)
The Tool is a thing you have, a physical object that you manipulate or wear that does something on your behalf. Although they're referred to as skills, your modifier for a tool might just as easily represent the tool's *quality* as it does your ability to use it. So you might have a very good sword that has a +1 modifier because it was made by a master craftsman, or it might be an ordinary sword that you've simply practiced extensively with.

**Sample Skills:**
- Sword
- Bow and Arrow
- Shield
- Spear
- Lockpicks
- Breastplate
- Lucky Helmet
- Trick Coin

## Clubs (The World)
The World refers to anything that is outside of yourself and that has a will and a context of its own. These skills are representative both of your ability to engage with those forces in a meaningful way, as well as the ability of those forces to act on your behalf when called.

Your friendship with the local baker might be a good World skill. Your affinity for Dark Places might also be a skill worth having in this category.

> Wait hang on. Friendship? What kind of skill type is that?
>
> Naming a friend as one of your skills means that you can call on that friend to do something that helps you in the current situation. It might be something they did in the past to set you up for success, or it might be something they do in the present moment. This is mostly a way to let the players engage with other characters in the world in a meaningful way without requiring the GM to manage those characters.
>
> Can you name another player's character as your ally? Sure! Just know that a player's character belongs to that player; you can't make someone's character do something their player doesn't want them to do just because you have a skill for them. In that case, ask the player how their character contributes to your success or well-being, and go from there.

- The Baker
- Emily
