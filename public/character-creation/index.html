                        </header>
                    <p>In this game, you play an echo, a creature of fragmented memory struggling to break free from the prison that was built to contain you. You don’t have to wrestle with this aspect of the game, it’s all narrative layering; if you want to just flip cards and roll dice, you can safely ignore most of this. But if you want to <strong>Create a Character</strong>, here’s how you do it.</p>
<p>Before you begin playing, you’ll need to make a quick record of your echo’s traits, so that when things start happening to and around you, you can see how they change your echo. For basic play, you’ll need to write down the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some representation of 3 Masks</li>
<li>The names of the four suits: Hearts, Clubs, Spades, Diamonds</li>
</ul>
<p>You can present this information however you like; below is an example if you need one.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left">Name: Emily</th>
<th style="text-align:right">Masks: ◯ ◯ ◯</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Spades</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:right">◯</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Clubs</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:right">◯</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Diamonds</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:right">◯</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Hearts</strong></td>
<td style="text-align:right">◯</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I recommend writing in pencil from now on, but if you wrote those pieces in pen or marker it shouldn’t disrupt things too much. You can give your echo a name or a title too (or both!), but it’s not required.</p>
<h2 id="mask-%26-health" tabindex="-1">Mask &amp; Health</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Every echo wears a mask, carved over an eternity out of hope. Your mask might be made of stone, or wood, or crystal, or cloth, or any other material. What it looks like is up to you. If your mask breaks, you can do nothing but repair and rebuild it, slowly, over centuries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanically, your mask serves as your echo’s health meter, represented as 3 circles. When the rules tell you to <strong>mark a mask</strong> or <strong>lose 1 health</strong> (and the rules may use these phrases interchangeably), scratch a line through one of those circles. You cannot mark a mask that has already been marked; you cannot lose health if you have none.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer, you can record your masks as a number, like so: 3 / 3. In this case, when the rules tell you to mark a mask, you instead reduce your current number by 1, i.e. 2 / 3. It’s up to you. <em>Write in pencil.</em></p>
<p>(The advanced rules provide ways to obtain up to 8 additional masks; if you’re playing with those rules, you will want to make sure you leave enough room for 11 masks total. <em>Again, write in pencil.</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="defeat%E2%80%A6" tabindex="-1">Defeat…</h3>
<p>If you go to mark one of your masks and you see that they’ve all been marked already, your character is <em>defeated</em>. Ordinarily, this would mean you’re out; just sit tight while the rest of the game plays out in front of you. If you’re playing with the advanced rules, the game might not be over when the current map is cleared; in that case, you rejoin the game at the start of the next map, in one of two ways:</p>
<h4 id="make-a-new-echo" tabindex="-1"><strong>Make a New Echo</strong></h4>
<p>Throw away this character sheet and write up a new one. This can make for a fun activity to do while you wait for the current map to be completed.</p>
<h4 id="revive-your-old-echo" tabindex="-1"><strong>Revive Your Old Echo</strong></h4>
<p>Keep the same character, and reset their masks to full. Optionally, tell the group how you escaped your fate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="suits" tabindex="-1">Suits</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the vault keeps the echoes contained, they each possess capabilities that come from an eternity spent in the dark. Some of these skills come from the person that inspired the echo. Others are born out of necessity to survive the vault’s many dangers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To represent your echo’s abilities, I’ve mapped each of the deck’s four suits to one of four <em>general categories</em> of action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spades:</strong> Actions involving specific tools, items, or weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Hearts:</strong> Actions involving movement through space.</li>
<li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> Actions involving interaction with the environment.</li>
<li><strong>Clubs:</strong> Special actions involving supernatural forces or other characters in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you engage in a dangerous challenge, you’ll choose one of these suits to represent your action in the scene. You can narrate your actions however you like, but again: you don’t have to.</p>
<p>When you use a suit, there’s always a chance that the suit will become damaged or compromised or misplaced. Whatever the narrative description you give for that outcome, mechanically speaking that suit becomes <strong>locked</strong>, meaning you cannot use it at all until it has been repaired.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="incapacitated%E2%80%A6" tabindex="-1">Incapacitated…</h3>
<p>If your turn begins with you not having any available suits, your character is <em>incapacitated</em>. Choose one of the following:</p>
<h4 id="accept-defeat" tabindex="-1">Accept Defeat</h4>
<p>You are <em>defeated</em>, as if you had marked all of your masks. If your goal is to have <em>someone</em> escape the area, this might be a better option.</p>
<h4 id="ask-for-help" tabindex="-1">Ask for Help</h4>
<p>The other players can try to roll suits on your behalf against one of your locked suits, accepting all of the risks associated with Unlocking a Suit.</p>
<p>You are still considered a participant in this effort (it’s your turn, after all), and since you have no dice to roll, your roll is treated as a <em>zero</em>, meaning you will automatically <strong>mark a mask</strong> at the end of the process, regardless of what happens.</p>
