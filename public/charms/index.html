                    <header><h1>Shards of Memory</h1>
                        
                        </header>
                    <p>When you first start playing, your character is an archetype, an empty vessel waiting for you to infuse it with life and purpose. This is what echoes are, in this setting. They have no will of their own, just an endless pattern of behavior that remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Once you complete your first escape, however, your echo picks up a fragment of <em>living</em> memory, and a glimmer of awareness. Each shard is different, and grants you some unique ability that you can use in certain situations to help you survive, or to exert your will on the world.</p>
<h2 id="the-shards" tabindex="-1">The Shards</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of how a shard is written.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="a-friend-in-need-(4-of-clubs)" tabindex="-1">A Friend in Need (4 of Clubs)</h3>
<p><em>You have a memory, a strong one, of someone who needed your help. In your memory, you did nothing. But now you know: you can change that choice.</em></p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Another player reveals the 4 of Clubs; you have a Clubs skill that is not locked.</p>
<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You may add your dice for that skill to the active player’s dice pool.</p>
<p>If this results in the player having more than 4 dice, they clear the challenge automatically, as if their Clubs rating was 4 or higher; they don’t need to roll.</p>
<p><strong>Fragment:</strong> You can use this ability on any 4, or on any numbered Club; if you do, the skill you use becomes <strong>locked</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a shard comes with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the shard and the card it’s attached to</li>
<li>A brief description of the type of memory tied to the shard, which the player can use to flesh out their character</li>
<li>Requirements for using the shard</li>
<li>A description of the shard’s effect</li>
<li>An optional rule, called a “Fragment”, that describes what happens if the player wants to force the shard into play outside of its established context.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be noticing that there’s potential here for a shard associated with each card in the deck, for a total of 54. Alternatively, we might have 14 shards: one for each card-face, with suits telling us some incidental aspect of the shard’s context.</p>
<p>I’m gonna try to write all of them, but if I can’t, here’s the rundown of how they work so you can write your own.</p>
<h2 id="designing-a-shard" tabindex="-1">Designing a Shard</h2>
<p>To start with, the shard should include some flavoring text to give the player context for the memory contained within the shard. This text establishes the ways in which the shard changes the character. It gives the character a piece of…themselves? The world? Something to think about, to strive toward. It gives them a reason to take action.</p>
<h3 id="choose-a-card" tabindex="-1">Choose a Card</h3>
<p>Every shard is attached to one of the following card faces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 - Skeleton Key:</strong> If Joker is in play, flip it over.</li>
<li><strong>3 - Push Harder:</strong> If you roll a 3, lock the skill instead of losing health.</li>
<li><strong>4 - A Friend in Need:</strong> If you’re not the active player, use a skill from the attached suit to lend that skill’s dice to the active player.</li>
<li><strong>5 - Whatever It Takes:</strong> Instead of rolling, lock a single skill.</li>
<li><strong>6 - High Five:</strong> If you are not the active player and the active player rolls a 6, that player recovers 1 health.</li>
<li><strong>7 - Lucky Break:</strong> Add one die to your dice pool.</li>
<li><strong>8 - A Taste of Victory:</strong> If you roll a 6, unlock one locked skill.</li>
<li><strong>9 - See Through Walls:</strong> After completing the challenge, look at one card that has not yet been revealed, then place it back where it was.</li>
<li><strong>10 - Bulwark:</strong> If you are not the active player and the active player rolls a 1-3 result, you take the consequence instead.</li>
<li><strong>Jack - I Saw That Coming:</strong> If you roll a 1, treat it as a 6 instead.</li>
<li><strong>Queen - Healing Wind:</strong> Instead of recovering your own health, every other player recovers 1 health.</li>
<li><strong>King - More to Find:</strong> Use a skill from the attached suit to complete a <strong>Dangerous Challenge</strong>; <em>every</em> player gains an item.</li>
<li><strong>Joker - Hold the Door:</strong> While the Catastrophe is in effect, on each player’s turn while the Catastrophe is active, instead of that player losing health, you lock one skill.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="choose-a-suit" tabindex="-1">Choose a Suit</h3>
<p>If the card face is not <em>Joker</em>, the shard also has a suit attached to it. This further limits when the shard can be used; if the card matches the shard’s suit, the player can use it.</p>
<h3 id="optional%3A-fragment" tabindex="-1">Optional: Fragment</h3>
<p>If the shard has a suit, you can include something that lets the player overcome the shard’s suit limit. The cost of doing so is always the same: the player must lock whatever skill they use to activate the shard. Some shards include this chosen skill in their effect.</p>
