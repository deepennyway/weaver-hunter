    <header><h1>Mnemons</h1>
        
        </header>
    <p>Mnemons can be found anywhere. They’re in the trees, in your hearth, in the ground beneath your feet. No, they’re not <em>everywhere</em>, but they exist and survive throughout the world. A mnemon is a living piece of memory that has developed consciousness and inhabits the world. Mnemons are not malicious by nature, although some of them can be dangerous, just like anything can be dangerous.</p>
<p>A mnemon is not a <em>thing</em>, but it sometimes inhabits things in order to survive. A memory of an avalanche might inhabit a rock. A memory of a campfire might inhabit the embers of that same campfire. If you find someone speaking to a stone as if it were a person, there’s at least a small chance that they are a weaver communicating with a mnemon, or someone wanting to be a weaver and not knowing the difference.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you will probably not even notice the mnemon’s presence. They go about their business, you go about yours, and you ignore each other. A trained weaver, or someone who otherwise has unusually strong sensitivity to the emotional life of the world around them, can detect the presence of mnemons and, with care, bond with them.</p>
<p>Bonding with a mnemon is not a thing to be undertaken lightly. Mnemons have needs and wants and <em>opinions</em>, and if you don’t want to hear those opinions every day, you might not want to form these bonds. Some people enjoy the company. Others enjoy the benefits that company offers.</p>
<p>Mnemons are powerful, and have a life of their own. When a weaver bonds with a mnemon, the weaver gains access to the mnemon’s capabilities, in exchange for serving as a riding vessel for the duration of that bond. A fire mnemon, for instance, might give a weaver the ability to create flames out of thin air without the need for tinder. A rain mnemon might let the weaver irrigate their crops without having to set up sprinklers or carry a watering can.</p>
<p>A mnemon has needs, we said before. Just like anyone has needs. And if the weaver wants a healthy relationship with their bonded mnemons, they will need to see to each mnemon’s needs and ensure they’re met. If not, a mnemon might choose to terminate the relationship ahead of schedule—and take a portion of the weaver’s power with them.</p>
<p>But if you are an empathic person, if you are someone who is prepared for the responsibilities of this kind of bond, here is what you need to know.</p>
<h2 id="bonding-with-a-mnemon" tabindex="-1">Bonding with a Mnemon</h2>
<p>No, you can’t just pick up a rock and take it with you and call that a bond. Every mnemon is different, even mnemons that look the same are unique and can’t be patterned into a relationship. If you want a pattern you can repeat at your own convenience, might we suggest learning patterns of <em>weaving</em> with all the many different risks associated therein.</p>
<p>Bonding with a mnemon is like meeting someone new and asking to be their friend. You must show respect in a way the mnemon both understands and appreciates, and find a way to communicate that works for both of you. Again, this will be different for every mnemon you meet. Take your time. Get to know each other. And if the mnemon doesn’t trust you, or doesn’t want to bond with you, be okay with that outcome too.</p>
<p>We won’t provide you with rules and mechanics for the bonding ritual, for all of these reasons and more. Instead, here is an <em>optional</em> way to determine if the bond was successful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roll a die.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the result is higher than a 3, you bond with the mnemon.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the mnemon refuses to bond with you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s all you need, and it’s optional. Use it if you want to establish that the bond was made but don’t want to spend time at the table playing out a scene. Sometimes that’s okay. Don’t overcomplicate it.</p>
<h2 id="effects-of-the-bond" tabindex="-1">Effects of the Bond</h2>
<p>Once the bond is formed, two things change for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>You gain access to all of the mnemon’s abilities.</li>
<li>You gain all of the mnemon’s traits.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the entry for a mnemon has a trait or ability that you already possess, it will include an augmentation to that trait or ability that you gain instead.</p>
<h2 id="terminating-a-bond" tabindex="-1">Terminating a Bond</h2>
<p>The terms of your bond should be established when the bond is formed. Each mnemon’s entry contains additional terms under which the bond can or must be terminated prematurely, and in addition you can always terminate an existing bond for any reason if the relationship is proving to be harmful to you or those around you in ways you are no longer comfortable with.</p>
<p>As a gameplay default, your bond with a mnemon ends if you die, or if you violate the terms of the bond. For example, a weaver that bonds with the Raging Inferno mnemon is prohibited from entering bodies of water. If that weaver goes for a swim or takes a bath, the mnemon will terminate the bond immediately.</p>
<p>You know these terms intimately, and cannot accidentally violate them. We say this not as a rule of what you are allowed to do, but rather as a guardrail against your own forgetfulness as a player. You, the player, might not recall all of the terms of your bonds with your various mnemons. But your character remembers all of them and will know whether or not it’s safe to violate them.</p>
<p>(If you do forget the terms of a bond during play and do something that you later realize would have been a violation, you can either retroactively change what happened in the story so the violation did not occur, or treat it as an intentional violation that terminates the bond.)</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This is the old stuff</em></p>
<p>If you have played games with magic in them before, you might think that a spell is something you cast to hurl fireballs or lightning bolts, and a spell can do those things, but here we are interested in establishing the context in which a spell exists in the world. So.</p>
<p>A spell is a piece of the world that has intelligence, that a careful weaver can make contact and form a bond with. The weaver’s bond with a spell is temporary; the spell will leave when the weaver and the spell are ready to part ways, or when the weaver does something to upset the spell. Spells are not to be dealt with lightly; they are powerful, but more than that they are a living part of the world. Abusing that life carries consequences.</p>
<p>Here you will find a collection of spells we’ve gathered: how and where to find them, how they are likely to affect you and those around you, and what they will do when you make use of their power.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-spell" tabindex="-1">Finding a Spell</h2>
<p>Spells are everywhere, as long as you know where and how to look for them. Each spell has its own requirements for where you might find it, and what you must do in order to communicate with the world’s living energies in order to form a bond.</p>
<p>Material requirements for each spell are also different, and are as much about understanding the energies you’re looking to bond with as they are about following instructions. You don’t need to roll dice to bond with a spell, although circumstances might demand you use one or more of your skills in pursuit of a place where you can find the spell in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="manifestations-of-a-spell" tabindex="-1">Manifestations of a Spell</h2>
<p>For as long as a spell travels within you, its presence is palpable, even if you or those around you cannot identify it as a spell specifically.</p>
<p>Each spell also confers upon its weaver a set of one or more passive adjustments to the weaver’s existing skills. Some skills are improved, others are diminished.</p>
<h2 id="casting-a-spell" tabindex="-1">Casting a Spell</h2>
<p>To cast a spell, use its suit and skill as if they were your own. You can cast the spell even if your Diamonds skill is locked; the spell’s suit is separate from your own.</p>
<p>You may cast a spell as often as you like until it leaves you, or until you release it (see below).</p>
<p>In the event that a bonded spell becomes locked during its use, the spell immediately leaves you as if it had been released.</p>
<h2 id="abusing-a-spell" tabindex="-1">Abusing a Spell</h2>
<p>Spells are alive, which means that they will know if you use them in ways they do not approve or appreciate. Some spells want to do violence, and have no problem being used that way. Other spells, like the <em>Flickering Flame</em>, will leave you if you make them attack an enemy directly.</p>
<p>If you abuse a spell’s needs, when it leaves you it will also lock one or more of your skills. These skills are named in the spell’s description.</p>
<p>Abuse a spell often enough, and you may find that it no longer is willing to bond with you. An especially corrupt weaver might find that try as she might, no fire will start in her presence, and even existing flames quickly snuff themselves out to avoid her.</p>
<h2 id="releasing-a-spell" tabindex="-1">Releasing a Spell</h2>
<p>You can release a bonded spell at any time, wherever the spell will be safe. Some spells, like <em>Quiet Snow</em>, cannot survive in the presence of extreme heat. Releasing a spell in a place where it cannot survive is a form of abuse, and carries consequences for the weaver as with any other abusive act.</p>
