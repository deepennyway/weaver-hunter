                    <p>This is the messy, “rules as I remember them” version of the game’s rules. The other chapters of this book do (or will, eventually) break down everything on this page in simpler, more procedural terms. If you want to read the messy stream-of-consciousness version, here it is.</p>
<p>“Is there any chance that some of the details are different?” hahahaha yes. Yes there is. There will almost certainly be differences, because the other chapters are me figuring out the Systems and Writing Them Down. <em>This</em> page is me trying to explain those systems more casually. I’m gonna get things wrong. I’m just gonna. Brain works sometimes not good.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is a game of suits and skills, designed around the rolling of six-sided dice and the drawing of cards from a poker deck.</p>
<p>Within this book, a single six-sided die with numbers from 1 through 6 is referred to as a d6. When the text mentions dice (i.e. “Roll your dice”), it refers to one or more d6. If you roll a 6 on a d6, it <em>explodes</em>: immediately roll an additional d6 and add it to your pool. If that d6 rolls a 6, it explodes as well. There is no limit to the number of exploding die you can have on a single turn.</p>
<p>Cards have the following components that are used for mechanics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suit (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts)</li>
<li>Face (2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker)</li>
<li>Color (Red and Black)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your character’s capabilities are described in the form of <strong>skills</strong>, and each skill is categorized under one of the four <strong>suits</strong>. If a suit becomes <strong>locked</strong>, you can’t use any skill under that suit.</p>
<p>Each suit has a <strong>rating</strong>, which tells you how many dice to roll when you use a skill from that suit. When you roll multiple dice, you examine the top-facing side of each die and keep only the highest result. If you have two or more 6 results, add 1 to the final result for each additional 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>One 6: 6</li>
<li>Two 6s: 7</li>
<li>Three 6s: 8</li>
<li>…and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of rating as your character’s general aptitude for a certain genre of activity: Spades represents affinity for tools, Hearts represents mastery of one’s physical self, Diamonds represents mental abilities like logic or memory (and also encompasses the weaving of magic), and Clubs represents one’s ability to influence or call upon their environment or allies. So if your character is physically capable, they’re likely to have a high rating in Hearts; if you want them to be good at magic, make sure they have a high Diamonds rating.</p>
<p>Each skill has a <strong>modifier</strong>, which tells you what to add to your dice result. Your dice result plus your modifier is the total used to calculate success or failure. If a skill has no modifier, you add nothing to your roll.</p>
<p>Your modifier represents your practiced proficiency with a specific type of activity, which enables you to achieve greater results than your base aptitude would allow you.</p>
<p>Each character has a <strong>strong suit</strong>, which gives them an advantage when using skills from that suit. Every skill in your strong suit adds that suit’s rating to its modifier.</p>
<p>When you use a skill, you’re aiming for an objective, and that objective determines the <strong>target number</strong> for your roll. The harder the task, the higher the target number. The GM assigns the target number in most cases; when fighting an enemy, the target number is provided in the enemy’s Bestiary entry.</p>
<h2 id="example" tabindex="-1">Example</h2>
<p>Emily has the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spades 2
<ul>
<li>Bow +1</li>
<li>Sword</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hearts 1
<ul>
<li>Jump</li>
<li>Dash +2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diamonds 2 <em>(strong)</em>
<ul>
<li>Fire Weaving +1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clubs 1
<ul>
<li>Hide</li>
<li>Ally: Baker +2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If she wants to use her Jump skill, she rolls a single d6 and adds nothing to it; her roll is her result. This means that if she needs to hit a target of 7 or higher, she needs to hope she rolls a 6 in order to gain an extra die that, maybe, will also be a 6.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if she uses Dash, she still rolls a single d6, but she adds +2 to her roll.</p>
<p>If she uses Fire Weaving, she rolls two dice and keeps the highest, then adds 3 to the result: 1 from her skill in Fire Weaving, and 2 from her rating in Diamonds.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-skill" tabindex="-1">Choosing the Right Skill</h2>
<p>There may be situational limits on what skills you can use, but most of the time you can use anything that’s in your skill list. If a skill seems inappropriate to the task at hand but you have no better alternatives, you can think of the skill you use as a thing that sets up the thing you really want to do. If it still seems far-fetched, the GM may adjust the target number accordingly, but the GM may not refuse to allow a skill that the player has chosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GM should tell the player the target number before they roll. The player can change their mind about their chosen skill or their chosen objective at any point up until the moment they roll the dice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, Emily needs to jump across a wide gap between buildings in order to pursue her target. Her Jump skill would be most appropriate, but the gap is wide and she’s nervous about not rolling high enough. So instead she chooses <em>Ally: Baker</em>, a skill with a +2 modifier. “Before we set out I stopped at the bakery to say hi to my friend, and they gave me my favorite power food: a bun stuffed with curried chicken. It gives me the energy I need to make this jump.”</p>
<p>The GM sets the target number at 5. Emily rolls her d6 and gets a 3, which with her +2 modifier is <em>just</em> enough to make it across the gap. “Remind me to buy the baker some flowers when we get back,” she says with relief, and then we move on with the chase.</p>
<h2 id="bands-of-success" tabindex="-1">Bands of Success</h2>
<p>When you use a skill, you want your result to be at least equal to the target number, but if you roll higher you have a chance of great things happening. Conversely, if you don’t quite hit the target number that’s usually okay, but if your result is 5 or more points <em>lower</em> than the target number, bad things happen.</p>
<p>In the following list, results are cumulative:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success (Meet or exceed the target):</strong> You achieve your objective.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Success (5 or more points higher than the target):</strong> You gain an advantage on your next roll.</li>
<li><strong>Failure (Lower than the target):</strong> You don’t achieve your objective OR you achieve your objective and take 1 damage.</li>
<li><strong>Dire Failure (5 or more points lower than the target):</strong> The skill you used becomes locked OR you take 1 damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in the above example with the jump between buildings, if Emily had missed the target number by rolling a 2 instead of a 3, she wouldn’t make it across the gap; or she could choose to make it across anyway, at the expense of taking damage. That choice always belongs to Emily, as does the choice of what shape the damage takes. Maybe she scrapes her leg when she lands, or maybe she has to grab the ledge in order to make it across and she wrenches her shoulder in the process.</p>
<p>If Emily had failed the roll by 5 or more, her <em>Ally: Baker</em> skill would have been locked, rendering it unusable until she spent time repairing it. In this case, that might mean spending more time with the baker and talking with them about her experience on the roof (probably with some interjections of the baker to the tune of “What were you thinking, of course a piece of food isn’t going to give you super powers, you need to be more careful!”).</p>
<p>Conversely, if Emily had somehow managed to roll a 10, beating the target number by 5 or more, she would end up with an advantage.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-the-advantage" tabindex="-1">Gaining the Advantage</h2>
<p>When you have the advantage on a roll, you add the suit’s rating to your modifier. This bonus stacks with the benefits of using your strong suit; so if Emily had advantage on her use of Fire Weaving, which is in her strong suit, her total modifier would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2 (strong suit) + 1 (skill modifier) + 2 (advantage) = +5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can give your advantage to another player if you like, setting them up for greater success with helpful action. This doesn’t cost you anything; you can even grant the advantage <em>after</em> the player has rolled, to turn a failure into a success—or to avert</p>
<h2 id="locked-skills-%26-suits" tabindex="-1">Locked Skills &amp; Suits</h2>
<p>When a skill becomes locked, you cannot use it at all. To unlock the skill, you must spend time repairing whatever was done to lock the skill in the first place. Maybe your sword needs mending, or maybe you see a doctor before you can jump again. Locks might be internalized instead; maybe you missed something in your environment that makes you distrust your own senses until you figure out what it was you missed.</p>
<p>Certain specific mechanics may mention temporarily locking a suit instead of a skill; in these cases, every skill under the locked suit becomes unusable until the lock is removed. Because these mechanics only appear during violent encounters with enemies from the Bestiary, they work a little differently; to unlock a suit, you just spend your turn unlocking it with one of your other skills.</p>
<h2 id="limiting-skill-use" tabindex="-1">Limiting Skill Use</h2>
<p>If the situation is volatile, your character might not have time to think about the best skill for the circumstances. The GM can represent this tension by asking the player to draw cards from the deck to determine what suits are available; fewer cards drawn means higher stress and fewer options.</p>
<p>For example, Emily makes it across the gap, but her quarry is about to get away from her, and she doesn’t have time to strategize her action. The GM tells her “Draw 2 cards to limit your choice of suit.”</p>
<p>She draws a Spade and a Heart. “That makes this easy,” she says, and chooses her Bow at +1. The GM assigns a target number of 6. Emily then rolls her two dice for Spades: a 4 and a 6, which explodes for an additional 6! Emily’s result looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7 (roll) + 1 (Bow modifier) = 8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That beats the target number, so she hits her quarry with her bow, pinning it to a nearby wall. “Okay,” Emily says, “let’s see if they’re willing to talk now.”</p>
<h2 id="can-you-die%3F" tabindex="-1">Can You Die?</h2>
<p>Your character dies if they reach 0 health.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you can’t die from just using your skills to pursue your objectives. The mechanics, for instance, won’t say that Emily falls to her death from failing her Jump check. So most of the time, the only way you can die is if you’re in a violent encounter with an enemy from the Bestiary, and that’s because those enemies fight back and deal damage, and you’ll know all of that before you engage with them.</p>
<p>If you fail a check and you want to achieve your objective anyway, you can choose the “take 1 damage” option, but that <em>usually</em> won’t result in your character dying, unless you take that option when you only have 1 health left. I can think of a few situations where you might want to do that, but most of the time it’s preferable to let the objective get away from you than to end your character’s life.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the GM’s arsenal that directly harms the players’ characters outside of the Bestiary, and that’s by design.</p>
<h3 id="returning-to-life" tabindex="-1">Returning to Life</h3>
<p>If you want a less lethal narrative where the characters controlled by the players survive to the end of the story, you can bring your character back from the dead whenever the group rests. Until that time you can’t take actions or use any of your skills, but you can still be present for scenes as a character in the story.</p>
<p>In practice, it’s a bit like making a new character that’s exactly the same as your old one, without having to make a whole new character sheet and without sitting idle at the table while the rest of the group continues to play without you.</p>
<h2 id="recovering-health" tabindex="-1">Recovering Health</h2>
<p>Like an empty vessel finding a bench, you recover all your lost health when you give yourself time to rest. Resting takes time, so you should only do it when you know you won’t be interrupted, but if the danger is distant and there is nothing pressing you for action, you can rest to restore your health.</p>
<p>Certain specific mechanics may also restore health, but outside of those specific circumstances: find a bench, and rest.</p>
<h2 id="the-bestiary" tabindex="-1">The Bestiary</h2>
<p>When your group is sent to deal with a specific enemy, the details for that enemy are housed in a Bestiary. The Bestiary tells us how much health an enemy has, its Offense and Defense scores, and anything else we need to know about its behavior during combat. It will tell us also what the enemy does or has done and why we might have been sent to kill it.</p>
<p>The entries in the Bestiary are for <em>specific beings</em>, not categories of foe. You won’t find an entry for “Soldier”, for instance. What you’ll find instead is an entry for “Commander Raggard”, a death-weaver with military ambitions who travels with a battalion of undead soldiers as he attempts to conquer the world one small settlement at a time. You’ll find everything you need to know about this particular Commander.</p>
<p>You can use the Bestiary provided in this book to come up with your own entries, but I highly recommend not using it as a way to form acceptable targets out of entire groups of people or animals.</p>
<h2 id="spells" tabindex="-1">Spells</h2>
<p>Spells are living pieces of the world that will join a weaver in their travels in the right circumstances. Not everyone calls them spells, but that’s the best approximation I can find for what they are that is still recognizable for what they are likely to be used for.</p>
<p>The spells in this book tell you what you need to know about various kinds of spells, but unlike the Bestiary, you can use these entries as approximations of any spells you find in your journey. Each spell’s entry tells you what you need to know about the spell, where to find it, how to treat it, and other things to consider when bonding with it.</p>
<p>Each spell also adds itself to your repertoire of skills and exists entirely separate from your other skills, meaning that if you have the Fire Weaving skill with a +2 modifier under the Diamonds suit with a rating of 1, and you bond with the Flickering Flames spell that has a rating of 6 with Diamonds and a modifier of +11 for Fire Weaving, you can use the spell’s Fire Weaving skill even if your own Fire Weaving skill is locked.</p>
<p>Most spells are extremely powerful, and should not be used lightly.</p>
<h2 id="starting-out" tabindex="-1">Starting Out</h2>
<p>To begin with, you have 4 health and one skill in each suit. Each suit begins with a rating of 1.</p>
<p>You also gain two additional skills, each of which you can assign to any suit of your choice. All of your skills begin with a modifier of 0.</p>
<p>You choose one suit to be your strong suit.</p>
<p>Finally, you get six points to assign freely to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase a suit’s rating by 1 (costs 2 points for each improvement)</li>
<li>Increase a skill’s modifier by 1</li>

<p>Let’s see how that works on a new character.</p>

<p>Those +1 modifiers feel <em>really good</em> on paper, and you also can tell right away that Hearts is going to be a good time with that +2 base modifier.</p>
<p>I recommend not adding the strong suit’s rating into the modifiers you record for each skill, because if the suit’s rating goes up you don’t want to have to change all the underlying modifiers as well. Just remember to add it when you use those skills.</p>
<p>Groundling can take four damage without dying. Which deosn’t seem like a lot, but remember: the choice to take damage is always Groundling’s, and the group can rest whenever they need to. We might set some limits around resting to let the players know when they <em>can</em> rest, or what they need to do in order to enable resting, but the intent here is that resting is almost always readily available when you need it, which <em>should</em> encourage players to take greater risks.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-your-character" tabindex="-1">Modifying Your Character</h2>
<p>You can change your chosen strong suit between missions but not during a mission. That’s because if you could change your strong suit whenever you wanted, you could just change your strong suit so that you always have your best modifier on whatever roll you’re making. That might not <em>ruin</em> the game but it would negate the purpose of the mechanic. If your group wants higher modifiers, just give everyone more points to spend when they create their characters.</p>
<p>You can also rename any of your skills whenever you like, but you may not move skills between suits.</p>
<p>If your character dies and you decide to keep playing the same character, you can reassign skills between suits and change your strong suit.</p>
<h2 id="character-advancement" tabindex="-1">Character Advancement</h2>
<p>When the group defeats an enemy, the next time they rest, everyone gains an additional 2 points to spend on improving their abilities. There’s no upper limit on modifiers, ratings, or health.</p>
