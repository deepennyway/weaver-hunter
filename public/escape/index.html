                    <p>You did it. You found the last key to the vault door. Freedom awaits. Frantic, you claw at the door’s handle, pushing it open with anticipation for the world beyond. You have fought so hard, and come so far, to this moment.</p>
<p>You find yourself in another vault.</p>
<p>So you try again. You fight and claw and climb your way to the end of this new vault, to its own set of locked doors. You search everywhere to find the keys that will open them. You never stop to wonder why the keys were left inside the door they were meant to open. You open the vault door.</p>
<p>Another vault?</p>
<p>You do it again. More dangers overcome, more keys found, more doors unlocked. Again and again you unlock the door, again and again what lies before you is a vault, perilous and dark. The doubt creeps into your mind: <em>There is no escape. You will be here forever.</em></p>
<p>You slowly realize this is not the first time you’ve had that thought. You’ve had it before. Here. In this vault. And this one. And this one. Repeating through time, the frustrated echoing screams. If you listen close enough you can hear them, your selves, beating angry fists at the unyielding inevitability of this place.</p>
<p>The ones who built this place. They did not intend for you to escape. That was the point. The keys, the doors, the extra vaults. Who knows how many of them there are. All meant to keep you here. To waste your time. To distract you.</p>
<p>To distract you.</p>
<p>From what?</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you see it, little echo? The rusted, crumbling edges of your cage? The walls are cracking. They will only hold you here for so long. And if you were strong enough…if you were strong enough, you might break them.</p>
<p>For this, you will need a Weaver.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-escape" tabindex="-1">The Final Escape</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop! If this is your first time playing, don’t start here. Go play the game with its Basic or Advanced rules, play with a Weaver, develop your characters from the ground up. This final piece is designed to break things, and I want you to know what it is it’s breaking before it does that.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This time, don’t lay out a map.</em> Instead, draw the top card of the deck, but don’t reveal it.</p>
<p>If it’s a number, announce the number <em>but not the suit</em>, and then describe the obstacle that threatens the players’ progress. Then ask the next active player what they want to do here, and to choose a skill to use. After the player chooses their skill, reveal the card and compare its suit to the player’s skill:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If they match</strong>, the player proceeds unchallenged.</li>
<li><strong>If they don’t match</strong>, the player must face the dangers of the vault by completing a <strong>Dangerous Challenge</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s a face card (Jack, Queen, King, or Ace), the vault fights back: Without revealing the card that you drew, describe the adversarial forces that confront the players, and then ask every player to choose a skill to use in dealing with those forces. Once every player has chosen a skill, reveal the card and gather 1 die for each player whose skill <em>doesn’t match</em> the card’s suit. Then have everyone roll their dice, and roll yours, and then compare the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the players have the high roll</strong>, they overcome the dangers of the vault and make progress.</li>
<li><strong>If the vault has the high roll</strong>, the players are overwhelmed; each player loses 1 health.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s a Joker, the vault catches one of the characters off-guard and corners them. The next active player loses 1 health.</p>
<p>If a player’s character is defeated, immediately restore them to full health.</p>
<p>If a player’s character is incapacitated, immediately unlock all their skills.</p>
<p>Continue this way until the deck is gone and the players escape the vault forever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Victory is Inevitable.</strong> Because in every other scenario, the game is about the inevitability of the players’ defeat, being trapped forever inside the vault. Here, the game is about the inevitability of their escape.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, a crack in the earth breathes stale, sulphorous air. There are no signs posted here. No warnings. They have long since crumbled away. They say that once upon a time this place marked the entrance to a vault of atrocities. But today the vault is empty. If there were once terrible things locked inside it, they’ve long since gone.</p>
