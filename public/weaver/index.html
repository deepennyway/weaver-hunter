                        </header>
                    <p>The base game provides a narrative context for why you’re in this area and why you want to escape, it gives you some texturing around what the dice and the cards represent, but it mostly gets out of your way and lets you just play the rules front to back without interruption.</p>
<p>But if you want more of a structured story, you might want to layer in atmospheric elements, you might want characters and dialogue, you might want <em>scenes</em>. To that end, this chapter should give you enough guidance to play the game in <strong>Weaver Mode</strong>, with a story you can engage with as the game goes on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do I need a Weaver to play in Weaver Mode?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Or, technically maybe not, you could use everything here and then play without a <em>dedicated weaver player</em>, it would all still work, but the experience will be different. You could share the weaver’s responsibilities among the players, like having each player act as the weaver for the player on their left, for example, or maybe each player is the weaver for a specific suit, or however you want to do it.</p>
<p>But probably you’ll have a better time just having one player take control of the non-player aspects of the story, especially if you’re not used to roleplaying games (this is a roleplaying game, Weaver Mode specifically is a roleplaying game).</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-weaver" tabindex="-1">The Weaver</h2>
<p>This mode introduces a new player type: The Weaver. The weaver is there <em>solely</em> to provide the story elements that layer on top of the base mechanics. When a card is flipped over, the weaver describes the room or the scene, and provides context for the players’ actions.</p>
<p>Mechanically speaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the <strong>Unlock a Suit</strong> move, the weaver rolls the dice for the suit that is being unlocked.</li>
<li>During the <strong>Explore</strong> move, the player indicates the card they wish to explore; then the weaver flips it over to reveal the scene.</li>
<li>At the start of each player’s turn, the weaver asks the player what they intend to do.</li>
<li>When the player decides on a move, the weaver provides the frame for the scene and then asks the player what suit or action they will use to resolve the challenge (if any), as well as what the player’s character is doing in this scene.</li>
<li>When resolving a scene, the weaver interprets the results and describes the effects for the benefit of the players.</li>
<li>When the Jokers are both in play, the weaver begins each player’s turn by describing how the catastrophe results in their marked mask.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Does the Weaver get a character to play?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is it’s up to you. If the weaver can manage their responsibilities as weaver and also the mechanics needed to control a character in the game, they can. Something to keep in mind, though, is that the weaver cannot ask questions of themself; when the weaver takes a turn, they are acting with full knowledge of the story they’re weaving together, which places their character in a slightly different context.</p>
<p>You can still do this, but my recommendation might be to treat your character as secondary to the story you’re telling: a mentor, or a guide, or a series of friends who act collectively. The reason for this is simple: <em>you</em> are the one framing the story. If you are also the player whose character does all the “cool stuff” in that story, then you run the risk of leaving the other players out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="setting-the-scene" tabindex="-1">Setting the Scene</h2>
<p>Setting a scene is straight-forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flip over the card the active player chooses.</li>
<li>Review the rules that will frame the scene (will it contain a challenge, are there items to be acquired, etc.).</li>
<li>Describe the scene for the benefit of the players.</li>
<li>Ask the active player what they plan to do to resolve the scene’s challenges, if any. Help them choose a suit or action to use if they need assistance.</li>
<li>Have the active player roll, if necessary.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>narrative outcome</em> of the scene.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>mechanical outcome</em> of the scene.</li>
</ol>
<p>This might look like a lot of steps, but the intent is that after a few times through, you’ll know what the cards represent well enough that you can breeze through the process without interruption.</p>
<h3 id="scene-prompts" tabindex="-1">Scene Prompts</h3>
<p>If you’re a seasoned weaver or you’ve come from other games where story is invented whole-cloth and you liked the way those games played, you can set up scenes and dice rolls however you like. If you need more guidance, though, you can use these prompts to help guide you:</p>
<p>First, a quick reference for what the cards mean mechanically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Numbered Cards:</strong> Complete a Dangerous Challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Jacks:</strong> Complete a Dangerous Challenge in order to receive a <strong>New Skill</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Queens:</strong> Recover lost health.</li>
<li><strong>Kings:</strong> Acquire a <strong>Useful Item</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Aces:</strong> Complete a Dangerous Challenge in order to open one of the area’s locks.</li>
<li><strong>Jokers:</strong> While the Joker is on the map, any time a player starts their turn, they must mark one of their masks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “How to Play the Game” chapter goes into more detail about each of these, but if you need inspiration.</p>
<p>If you need more help setting the narrative context for your challenges, here are some vague ideas to offer some inspiration:</p>
<ul>
<li>A meeting, interrupted.</li>
<li>A gift with conditions.</li>
<li>A sanctuary threatened.</li>
<li>A path with many branches.</li>
<li>A reminder of where you come from.</li>
<li>A secret dearly kept.</li>
<li>A glimpse of infinity.</li>
<li>A river you cannot cross.</li>
<li>An opening to somewhere new.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still need more? Here’s some extra prompts for the suits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Suits</strong></p>
<p>If you want something more specific, you can map out the suits to specific types of challenge. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hearts:</strong> The air is thick with something, making it harder to breathe.</li>
<li><strong>Diamonds:</strong> The area is difficult to navigate: overgrown foliage, or fallen pieces of debris, or broken floors.</li>
<li><strong>Spades:</strong> The area is full of hazards and deadly mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Clubs:</strong> The area is occupied by hungry beasts, no less trapped than you.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Face Cards</strong></p>
<p>The face cards all present special events, so I won’t give you specific prompts for them. But here are some ideas to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jacks</strong> are trials for the player to overcome, which push them to their limits and beyond. The outcome is a new skill, obtained as a predestined reward for completing the challenge. The challenge could be a rival traveler, or it could be a series of environmental obstacles.</li>
<li><strong>Queens</strong> are restful places that give the player an opportunity to recover something they’ve lost. That recovery could be supernatural, like a spring filled with magical waters, or it could be more mundane, like a comfortable bed to rest in.</li>
<li><strong>Kings</strong> are troves of useful items that the player can take with them to avoid future dangers. The trove might come in the form of an abandoned storeroom, or it might be something left behind by a traveler who didn’t make it out.</li>
<li><strong>Aces</strong> are the wards that block the exit from the area, and the players will need to find all of them in order to escape. The wards could be anything, but disabling them requires completing a dangerous challenge, so they likely involve some kind of hazard.</li>
<li><strong>Jokers</strong> are harbingers of the catastrophe that was sealed away here, and once they are revealed they become an ever-present danger to the players. It might be a new catastrophe in every area, or the same one coming back again and again and again…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="breaking-the-rules-with-intention" tabindex="-1">Breaking the Rules With Intention</h2>
<p>The weaver’s job is partly to add narrative context to the game; the weaver’s other job is to <em>explicitly and carefully break the rules</em> when it’s appropriate.</p>
<p>If the cards or the dice interfere with the story you’re building with the other players, you can take some specific steps to steer things in the direction you want. I’m going to lay out <em>specific ways to break the rules</em> here, because I want you to have some guidance about how or why you might want to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change the Card:</strong> When a card is revealed and you’re not ready for that card to appear in the story yet, you can swap it out for any other card that has not yet been revealed. This will require some card shuffling to keep things interesting, so I’ll break it down below with an example of how it could play out.</li>
<li><strong>Skip the Dice:</strong> If a card requires a Dangerous Challenge, you can remove that challenge entirely, letting the player pass unscathed.</li>
<li><strong>Grant a Bonus Die:</strong> If a player’s scene seems like the kind of thing that would give them an inherent advantage, you can let the player roll an additional die. Note that this does not grant the player a permanent boost to their suit rating, just a temporary extra die to roll for that scene’s challenge.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-the-card" tabindex="-1">Change the Card</h3>
<p>It’s the first turn, and Emily explores the first room to reveal…a Joker! That sets the stakes a lot higher than you expected, and runs the risk of ending the game before it even started. What’s a weaver to do?</p>
<p>The short answer: just swap it out for another card. But when the cards are laid out in a grid, that gets a little complicated. Here’s how I would do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up the Joker that Emily just revealed.</li>
<li>Pick up another card that hasn’t been revealed yet, and put it in the spot that Emily just revealed.</li>
<li>Pick up <em>at least two other cards</em> that haven’t been revealed yet.</li>
<li>Shuffle these other cards together with the Joker, and then place them back into the map face-down.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, the players have some sense of where that Joker <em>might</em> be but they don’t know for sure. The first turn still plays out with a surprise, but we save the catastrophe for later, when we know a little more about what that Joker means within the story.</p>
<p><strong>How to Frame it:</strong> Maybe it’s a false alarm; Emily trips over a cable that leads to an explosive device…but it’s been disabled. Or maybe the card ran off; Emily sees a shadow in the corner of the room like something big and deadly, but then she blinks–and it’s gone.</p>
<p>You don’t have to frame it this way, but if you want a way to justify the card swap within the story, you can.</p>
<h3 id="skip-the-dice" tabindex="-1">Skip the Dice</h3>
<p>Emily’s badly hurt, her sword is broken, but she needs to keep moving; she can’t afford to waste time trying to fix her weapon. She rounds the corner to reveal: A Jack of Spades. You know she needs the bow in this room, but if she rolls badly here, that will be the end of the game. So you make a split-second decision: skip the challenge, and let her have the bow for free.</p>
<p>Here, the process is easy. Just hand her the usual reward for the Jack: a new action for the Spades suit, no dice required. But be careful; if you skip challenges all the time, the players might start to expect that they won’t have to fight for their new skills.</p>
<p><strong>How to Frame it:</strong> My favorite way to frame the skipped dice roll is to say that someone else got here before you and dealt with the dangers on your behalf. Emily might not know who’s fighting her battles for her, but now you’ve added a layer of mystery to the game: who is it that helped her here? Will they come back later? What is it they want?</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> skip the dice in an <strong>Unlock a Suit</strong> move, but it’s a delicate balance; players should have some expectation about the risks of spending their turn to unlock a suit before they choose to do so.</p>
<h3 id="grant-a-bonus-die" tabindex="-1">Grant a Bonus Die</h3>
<p>Emily enters a big room full of glowing moving targets, and she laughs. “This room was <em>made</em> for my new bow, wasn’t it.” You laugh too; you hadn’t realized it when you described the chamber, but yes, it does look tailor-made to the tools at Emily’s disposal.</p>
<p>“Okay,” you say. “Go ahead and roll your Bow action. Take an extra die on this one, too.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing easier than granting someone an extra die to roll. The only thing to watch out for is that extra dice tip the scales of probability in the players’ favor. Which isn’t a bad thing, but it’s worth keeping in mind. <em>Never take dice away.</em></p>
<p><strong>How to Frame it:</strong> There’s not much framing that needs to be done here. You’ve already got the narrative frame; it’s where the bonus die came from.</p>
<p>A player can ask for a bonus die, sure. Ask them to justify it if you want, or just say yes. Remember: bonus dice granted this way are temporary and only last for the duration of the single roll.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you could look at the room you just described and Emily’s skill with the bow and say “You know what, don’t even bother rolling; the architects of this complex clearly didn’t expect to contend with a master archer like yourself. Just tell me how cool it looks, and let’s move on.” That would be the same thing as Skipping the Dice (above), just coming at it from another direction.</p>
