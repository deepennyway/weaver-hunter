                    <p>Sometimes things happen that the world—not the people of the world, but the world itself—cannot let go of. A friendship ended over a misunderstanding, an outbreak of disease worsened by greed, a war fought over abundance.</p>
<p>The world roils and churns its thoughts about that thing, trying to reconcile it, to resolve it, to lay it to rest. When the people of the world don’t or can’t resolve these things, the world has no choice but to work on them itself, alone. The product of that lonely work is an <strong>echo</strong>.</p>
<p>When an echo appears in the world, it might look exactly like the person or people involved in the event, but frequently it is a distorted memory formed from the world’s imperfect perspective. They might have different hair, or wear different clothing, but they are an embodiment of the event they were created to resolve.</p>
<p>Once an echo is in the world, it will attempt to repeat the event that created it until the world understands what happened, or until the people of the world find a way to resolve it. A dispute between friends might be easy; the once-friends either talk things out and become friends again, or find a way to let go of their dispute and part ways. Wars are harder. Much harder.</p>
<p>At the height of their power, the imperial dragons sought many ways to stop the world from creating echoes. Echoes were loud, inconvenient reminders to the subjugated masses of the terrible things the dragons had done or continued to do in less visible ways. Every time the dragons denied someone a house to live in, or food to eat, the world would form an echo to let everyone in the town know:</p>
<p><em>The empire did this to you. You did not do it to yourself. You do not have to accept it.</em></p>
<p>And the echo would stay until that person was housed, or fed, or clothed.</p>
<p>Inconvenient. Dangerous. Something had to be done. So the dragons did what they always did: something terrible.</p>
<p>With the help of a school of mages, the dragons built a device, a Tower, to detect the echoes at the moment of their formation and siphon their mnemonic energy away, storing it in a massive underground vault. The vault was filled with traps and mechanisms to keep the echoes busy, and to keep them out of the public eye. “Let the world have its little funerals,” the dragons said, “safely out of view.”</p>
<p>But an echo can only be buried so long. The longer the world churns on a memory, the more it takes on a life of its own, with thoughts and will and purpose. The buried echoes will escape, the Grey Mage said. Eventually, they will break free. And they will tell the people of the world:</p>
<p><em>The empire did this to you. You did not do it to yourself. And you do not have to accept it.</em></p>
